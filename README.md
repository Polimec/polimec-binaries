# Polimec Binaries Repository

## Welcome to Our Temporary Public Repository for Pre-Compiled Binaries!

### Introduction

Hello and thank you for your interest in Polimec! This repository is a dedicated space for hosting the Polimec pre-compiled binaries. As we're in the process of transitioning towards open sourcing our main repository, this platform serves as an interim solution for our users to access the latest builds.

### What You'll Find Here

In this repository, you'll find the latest stable versions of our binaries, ready for download and use. These are compiled from our private main repository, ensuring you have access to the most recent and robust version of our product.

### Temporary Measure

Please note that this is a temporary measure. Our main goal is to eventually open our primary repository to the public, providing full access to our source code and fostering a community-driven development process. This temporary binary repository is a step towards that goal, ensuring our users have continued access to our product during this transition.

### Download and Usage

To use the binaries, simply download the relevant file from the 'Releases' section. Please refer to our [Collator documentation](https://hackmd.io/@poliboys/HyLS_J9Ia) for detailed instructions on installation and usage.

### Feedback and Contributions

While this repository is primarily for distribution, we value your feedback. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please feel free to raise them in the 'Issues' section of this repository. Your input is crucial for us to improve.
